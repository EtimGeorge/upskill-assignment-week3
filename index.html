      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I am George Samuel Etim, a passionate tech enthusiast based in Enugu, Nigeria.<br> As an active participant in the Upskill program run by Genesys Tech Hub, I am committed to continuous learning, growth, and innovation in the tech industry. <br> With a versatile background across multiple roles, I bring a unique perspective to the table. <br> As a stock controller and floor manager at Game Discount World, I honed my organizational skills while ensuring smooth operations. <br> My role as a system coordinator and stock-take coordinator further refined my attention to detail. <br> Transitioning to Saencrystal Specialty Stores as a General Store manager allowed me to lead by example, fostering a motivated team and delivering exceptional customer experiences. <br> Meanwhile, at Saencrystal Global Agency, I embraced my passion for web development and branding, crafting digital solutions that resonate with audiences. <br> My tenure as a Business Development Executive at Progital sharpened my strategic thinking and relationship-building abilities, contributing to the company's growth. <br>Simultaneously, my role as an import and export agent at Aradbranding deepened my understanding of global markets and trade dynamics.</p>
